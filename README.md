# Nexus-version-01
The project was made with MySQL, PHP, HTML, and Tailwind CSS. 
This was the project of my "Database Management Systems Lab" and "System Analysis and Design Lab". 
See "nexus doc v1" for further details. This is just the first version. I will upload a better version soon. 

Note: There is one bug, though. A post can't be deleted if any user has liked/disliked it. It seems like a database problem. I will soon fix that. Other than that, every other feature works fine and to its fullest. 

I did this project on XAMPP, so to make the project work: 

*Create a new folder named 'Nexus' within the "htdocs" folder of XAMPP files 
*Put all the files in the 'Nexus' folder.
